# Penrose-Body-Fat-Analysis  
This project analyzes the Pentose body fat dataset, focusing on the relationship between various physiological measurements and body fat percentage among men.

## Objective
To identify significant predictors of body fat percentage using correlation analysis and linear regression, and to assess the implications for health assessments.

## Features
- Correlation Analysis: Examine the relationship between body fat and various predictors (age, weight, height, etc.).
- Statistical Significance: Calculate p-values to determine the significance of correlations.
- Linear Regression: Build a regression model to predict body fat based on abdomen circumference.
- Visualization: Utilize ggplot2 to visualize relationships between variables.
